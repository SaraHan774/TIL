- OOP capabilities

	- Language 
	- Compiler : Converts TypeScript code into native JavaScript, but also provides the programmer with assistance in writing code with fewer errors. 
- Developer can write code that is easier to understand and refactor and contains fewer bugs. 
- Adds discipline to the development workflow by forcing errors to be fixed while still in development.

- TypeScript has no runtime. It uses a process called transpilation. 
- Transpilation is a method where code from one language is "compiled" or converted into another language. 
- What this means is that all TypeScript code ultimately is converted into JavaScript code before it is finally deployed and run.
